Using ngrams, we can mention just single words or pairs of words that are stop words, use the English dictionary of stop words, or don't use stop words, which means in the first case we need to get rid of common words, and in the second case we do not get rid of common words. Using TF-IDF, we use JEG to state whether it's yes or no. The random forest we created uses 20, 50, or 100 trees. Using this, we can perform a grid search, which runs through all of the combinations of parameters and finds out what the best combination is. So, let's give our pipeline number 2, which has the TF-IDF along with it."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"scrolled":true,"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"_zxTQyfEpzba","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1617190573565,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":114226,"user":{"displayName":"edin professional","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Ggy59xF9qH9HdbydTFQu1agfySzcT10t0xRnY6lHF4=s64","userId":"09805872942347560488"}},"outputId":"6c0b7c61-8996-45fb-fb38-a9308e0b893e"},"source":["grid_search.fit(d_content, d_label)"],"execution_count":143,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Fitting 5 folds for each of 72 candidates, totalling 360 fits\n"],"name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"stream","text":["[Parallel(n_jobs=-1)]: Using backend LokyBackend with 2 concurrent workers.\n","[Parallel(n_jobs=-1)]: Done  46 tasks      | elapsed:   12.5s\n","[Parallel(n_jobs=-1)]: Done 196 tasks      | elapsed:  1.0min\n","[Parallel(n_jobs=-1)]: Done 360 out of 360 | elapsed:  1.8min finished\n"],"name":"stderr"},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["GridSearchCV(cv=None, error_score=nan,\n","             estimator=Pipeline(memory=None,\n","                                steps=[('countvectorizer',\n","                                        CountVectorizer(analyzer='word',\n","                                                        binary=False,\n","                                                        decode_error='strict',\n","                                                        dtype=<class 'numpy.int64'>,\n","                                                        encoding='utf-8',\n","                                                        input='content',\n","                                                        lowercase=True,\n","                                                        max_df=1.0,\n","                                                        max_features=None,\n","                                                        min_df=1,\n","                                                        ngram_range=(1, 1),\n","                                                        preprocessor=None,\n","                                                        stop_words=None,\n","                                                        strip_accents=None,\n","                                                        token...\n","             iid='deprecated', n_jobs=-1,\n","             param_grid={'countvectorizer__max_features': (None, 1000, 2000),\n","                         'countvectorizer__ngram_range': ((1, 1), (1, 2)),\n","                         'countvectorizer__stop_words': ('english', None),\n","                         'randomforestclassifier__n_estimators': (20, 50, 100),\n","                         'tfidftransformer__use_idf': (True, False)},\n","             pre_dispatch='2*n_jobs', refit=True, return_train_score=False,\n","             scoring=None, verbose=1)"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":143}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"vlDAEUybos9m"},"source":["fit to perform the search."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"scrolled":true,"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"0YRmAhOOpzba","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1617190573565,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":113898,"user":{"displayName":"edin professional","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Ggy59xF9qH9HdbydTFQu1agfySzcT10t0xRnY6lHF4=s64","userId":"09805872942347560488"}},"outputId":"8ed33c5a-6cae-4692-b822-1d289e998dc9"},"source":["print(\"Best score: %0.3f\" % grid_search.best_score_)\n","print(\"Best parameters set:\")\n","best_parameters = grid_search.best_estimator_.get_params()\n","for param_name in sorted(parameters.keys()):\n","    print(\"\\t%s: %r\" % (param_name, best_parameters[param_name]))"],"execution_count":144,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Best score: 0.960\n","Best parameters set:\n","\tcountvectorizer__max_features: None\n","\tcountvectorizer__ngram_range: (1, 1)\n","\tcountvectorizer__stop_words: None\n","\trandomforestclassifier__n_estimators: 100\n","\ttfidftransformer__use_idf: True\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Hj5pLe5rpNsn"},"source":["Since there is a large number of words, it takes a little while, around 40 seconds, and ultimately finds the best parameters.\n","It shows nearly 96% accuracy.It used around 2000 words, only single words, used yes to get rid of stop words, had 100 trees in the random forest, and used yes and the IDF and the TF-IDF computation."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"PUkq1t-vs8Dg"},"source":["#4.2\n","The outputs are correct except the last output.
